An interactive web-based visualization of the cell cycle, showcasing its phases (G0, G1, S, G2, M, and Interphase) with tooltips providing detailed descriptions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project uses a background image (`cell_cycle.png`) to guide users, with transparent, circular phase areas that reveal information on hover or click.

## Features
- **Interactive Phases**: Hover or click on each phase (G0, G1, S, G2, M, Interphase) to display a tooltip with a brief description.
- **Transparent Design**: Phases are invisible circles, relying on the `cell_cycle.png` background for visual context, creating a clean and image-driven experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop and mobile, with click support for touch devices.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Smooth hover animations (scale and rotate) enhance user interaction.
- **Custom Tooltip**: G0 Phase has a wider tooltip (300px) for improved readability.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo>
   ```
3. Ensure `cell_cycle.png` is in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser:
   - Use a local web server for best results (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`).
   - Access at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Hover over phase areas to view tooltips with phase descriptions.
3. Click phases on mobile devices to toggle tooltips.
4. The Interphase "Core" label is visible at the center; other phases are transparent, guided by `cell_cycle.png`.

## Deployment
Host the project on GitHub Pages:
1. Push `index.html` and `cell_cycle.png` to your repository.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** in your GitHub repository.
3. Set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Save, and access your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>`.

Alternatively, deploy on:
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com): Drag and drop files.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): Import repository or upload files.
- [Surge](https://surge.sh): Use `npm install -g surge` and `surge`.
